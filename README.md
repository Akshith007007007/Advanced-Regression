Surprise Housing, a housing company based in the United States, has made the strategic decision to expand its operations into the Australian market. Employing a data-driven approach, the company leverages data analytics to acquire properties below their market values and subsequently sell them at higher prices. To facilitate this expansion, the company has compiled a dataset derived from the sale of houses in Australia

As part of the market entry strategy, the company is actively seeking prospective properties to purchase. Task is to construct a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the true value of these potential acquisitions. This model will aid in the decision-making process, guiding Surprise Housing on whether to invest in specific properties.

The primary objectives of the analysis are twofold:

Identify the variables that significantly contribute to predicting the price of a house.
Evaluate the effectiveness of these variables in describing the house prices accurately.
By addressing these key points, the company aims to make informed investment decisions based on a robust understanding of the Australian housing market dynamics.
